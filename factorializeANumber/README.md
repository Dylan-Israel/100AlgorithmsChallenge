Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.

**Example**
-   factorializeANumber(5) returns 120;
-   factorializeANumber(10) returns 3628800;

Consider integer numbers from 0 to n - 1 written down along the circle in such a way that the distance between any two neighbouring numbers is equal (note that 0 and n - 1 are neighbouring, too).

Given n and firstNumber, find the number which is written in the radially opposite position to firstNumber.

**Example**

For n = 10 and firstNumber = 2, the output should be
circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) = 7.

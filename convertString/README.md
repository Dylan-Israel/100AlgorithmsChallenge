You are given the string s. Your friend just asked you if it's possible to change the string from s to a string t by removing some characters from it. You're a pro at programming, so you decided to create a program to determine this.

**Example**
-   For s = "ceoydefthf5iyg5h5yts" and t = "codefights", the output should be
convertString(s, t) = true.

-   For s = "addbyca" and t = "abcd", the output should be
convertString(s, t) = false.

**Hints**
-   concat()
-   split()

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)**
- **[input] string s**
    A string with alphanumeric characters.

    *Guaranteed constraints:*

    1 ≤ s.length ≤ 1000.

- **[input] string t**

    A string with alphanumeric characters.

    *Guaranteed constraints:*
    1 ≤ t.length ≤ 1000.

-   **[output] boolean**
    Return true if it is possible to convert s to t, otherwise return false.
